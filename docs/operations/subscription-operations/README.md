# Subscription operations

Azure documentation describes programmatic subscription creation for both [Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/programmatically-create-subscription-microsoft-customer-agreement?tabs=rest) and [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/programmatically-create-subscription-enterprise-agreement?tabs=rest), including support for [cross-tenant scenarios and service principal automation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/programmatically-create-subscription). This section groups the MCA and EA subscription operation guides and related automation patterns from this site so you don't have to hunt across folders.
