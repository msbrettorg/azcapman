# Capacity & quotas

Azure guidance for capacity planning, reliable scaling, quota management, capacity reservations, and quota groups provides the foundation for the capacity and quota-oriented material collected in this site.[^capacity-planning][^reliability-scaling][^quota-groups][^cr-overview][^quota-monitoring] This section curates links to capacity planning, reservation governance, quota operations, and quota monitoring references in one place.

Use this hub when you're planning or reviewing capacity and quotas and need to route stakeholders to the right reference:

- Capacity planning framework—structure forecasting and scaling decisions before you change quotas.[^capacity-planning]
- Quota operations reference—audit and adjust quotas, quotas groups, and region access.[^quota-groups][^quota-monitoring]
- Capacity reservation reference—reserve and share capacity across subscriptions.[^cr-overview]
- Monitoring and alerting reference—configure and operate quota monitoring and alerting.[^quota-monitoring]
